This App was created as way of reviewing my understanding of MERN stack.

##  We used the following imports:

1. **react-redux** - for state management purposes
2. **@reduxjs/toolkit**
3. **redux-persist** - allows saving Redux store in the local storage of an application
4. **dotenv** - for storing environment variables, they get automatically loaded into the runtime environment.
5. **formik** - helps us handle form data
6. **yup** - validates data to make sure it matches the Schema
7. **react-router-dom** - to build single-page applications
8. **mui-material** - provides predefined components to implement design
9. **emotion** - perfomant and flexible CSS-in-JS library
